A format in excel can be defined as the change of appearance of the data in the cell the way it is, without changing the actual data or numbers in the cells. That means the data in the cell remains the same, but we will change the way it looks.
Custom number formats can control the display of numbers, dates, times, fractions, percentages, and other numeric values. Using custom formats, you can do things like format dates to show month names only, format large numbers in millions or thousands, and display negative numbers in red.
By default, cells start with the General format applied. The display of numbers using the General number format is somewhat "fluid". Excel will display as many decimal places as space allows, and will round decimals and use scientific number format when space is limited. The screen below shows the same values in column B and D, but D is narrower and Excel makes adjustments on the fly.
You can select standard number formats (General, Number, Currency, Accounting, Short Date, Long Date, Time, Percentage, Fraction, Scientific, Text) on the home tab of the ribbon using the Number Format menu.
To create custom number format follow this simple 4-step process:

Select cell(s) with values you want to format
Control + 1 > Numbers > Custom
Enter codes and watch preview area to see result
Press OK to save and apply 
Tip: if you want base your custom format on an existing format, first apply the base format, then click the "Custom" category and edit codes as you like.
You can't really edit a custom number format per se. When you change an existing custom number format, a new format is created and will appear in the list in the Custom category. You can use the Delete button to delete custom formats you no longer need.
